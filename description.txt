The mod automatically searches and plays alternative mp3 files for Heroes 3 music themes.

When the game starts, the Mp3 directory is recursively scanned. All files in it and subfolders are sorted by topic.
Numeric suffixes are ignored. So, dirt.mp3, WoW_Music/dirt007.mp3 and Music_Pack/dirt02.mp3 will be added to the playlist of the "dirt" theme.

Tracks from playlists are changed automatically, based on the settings from json config file to ensure maximum variety and comfort.
